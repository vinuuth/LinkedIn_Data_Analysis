The methodology includes researching the theory and basis of the most commonly used psychological tests, training different models with data open source data from a psychological test, using different feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant questions, and then training optimized models with a reduced number of features to compare the outcomes.\n\nFor more information, results, references and description of the project, please refer to the paper.
