I have completed coursework in security operations, digital forensics and cyber attacks and defenses, and I have published a paper on knowledge graph for client complaint management using natural language processing and machine learning during my undergraduate studies.\n\nI am also gaining hands-on experience in network security monitoring and threat detection as a graduate teaching assistant at OSU, where I mentor and supervise 20+ students in the security operations center (ORTSOC) to perform network log monitoring and daily threat intelligence gathering. We have been successful in detecting multiple security incidents for our clients. Additionally, I have designed and developed a digital forensics course curriculum for high school students and taught the same at the NW Cyber Camp 2023. I have also received the BaxI Award for creating an Oracle APEX application for raw material tracking that is used globally by Baxter.\n\nI am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in cyber security to real-world problems and learn from industry professionals. I am looking for an full-time opportunity in cyber security where I can contribute to the team's goals and objectives, and grow as a security analyst, engineer, or researcher.
