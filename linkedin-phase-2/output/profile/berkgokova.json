I have a depiction of a future that I cannot resist, where society is more mobile, free, minimalist, and vibrant than it was ever before. \n\nI am particularly focusing on the manifacturing of electroactive fibers, flexible electronics, and artificial muscles. I believe that it is possible to invent many types of wearables by combining different types of electroactive polymers with flexible electronic circuits. Therefore, my current research targets the synthesis and optimization of fiber actuators, which are capable of setting up the basis for artificial muscles and smart textiles.", "country": "DK", "country_full_name": "Denmark", "city": "Copenhagen", "state": "Capital Region of Denmark", "experiences": [{"starts_at": {"day": 1, "month": 7, "year": 2022}, "ends_at": null, "company": "SUNUM-Sabanc\u0131 University Nanotechnology Research and Application Center ", "company_linkedin_profile_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/sunumsabanci", "title": "Researcher - Conductive Elastic Nanofiber Films for Stretchable Lithium-ion Batteries", "description": "The production of stretchable batteries will be a milestone in flexible electronics.
